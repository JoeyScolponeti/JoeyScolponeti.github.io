        My name is Joey Scolponeti, and I am a fourth year at
        Northeastern University studying data science and business.
        Alongside data visualization, I'm taking some machine learning
        courses, and also a songwriting class as an elective. This isn't
        my first data visualization course, since I took a course primarily
        taught in Tableau through the business school last year. I just came
        off a co-op with Verizon, where I was in New Jersey for six months
        doing data science. I recently accepted a position to return with
        them after I graduate this summer. In my free time, I've been enjoying
        the fact that I don't have to worry about applying for jobs, and
        going around to a bunch of different events around the city. I'm being
        a lot more social now than I was back when I started college, and I've
        honestly never felt better. I've also been playing a lot of piano recently
        too with my songwriting class, and I'm getting super back into music again.
        I also play a good amount of video games, mostly story games that I play
        with other people at the same time so we can discuss them like a book club
        of sorts. I'm definitely making the most out of my last year of college.
