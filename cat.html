        This is my cat Lacey. She is a Maine Coon mix, and I've had her
        since I was in the 1st grade. This means that this April, she will be
        15 years old, which is a very long life span for a cat. Even with how old she is,
        she still acts like a kitten. She's still very energetic, friendly, and full
        of love. During middle and high school, whenever I would do homework on my
        laptop in my bed, she would jump up beside me and lay against me under my arm.
        I would put my arm over her, and sometimes she'd look back up
        at me and it had to be the cutest thing ever. I have so many old photos of me
        as a little kid with her, and we pretty much grew up together. She has a
        very silly history too, where she's done a lot of dangerous things but
        somehow survived. At an old apartment, she jumped off a second story balcony
        and landed in a tree unscathed. She's also escaped and survived in the woods
        a couple times, returning home like absolutely nothing has happened. I love
        going home every once in a while to see her, since no matter how long I'm
        gone, she still loves to be with me.
